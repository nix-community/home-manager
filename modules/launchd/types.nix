  /* *
     A type of list which does not allow duplicate elements. The base/inner
     list type to use (e.g. `types.listOf` or `types.nonEmptyListOf`) is passed
     via argument `listType`, which must be the final type and not a function.

     NOTE: The extra check for duplicates is quadratic and strict, so use this
     type sparingly and only:

       * when needed, and
       * when the list is expected to be recursively short (e.g. < 10 elements)
         and shallow (i.e. strict evaluation of the list won't take too long)

     The implementation of this function is similar to that of
     `types.nonEmptyListOf`.
