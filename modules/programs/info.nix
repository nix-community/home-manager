# info.nix -- install texinfo and create `dir` file

# This is a helper for the GNU info documentation system. By default,
# the `info` command (and the Info subsystem within Emacs) gives easy
# access to the info files stored system-wide, but not info files in
# your ~/.nix-profile.

# Specifically, although info can then find files when you explicitly
# ask for them, it doesn't show them to you in the table of contents
# on startup. To do that requires a `dir` file. NixOS keeps the
# system-wide `dir` file up to date, but ignores files installed in
# user profiles.

# This module contains extra profile commands that generate the `dir`
# for your home profile. Then when you start info (and both `dir`
# files are in your $INFOPATH), it will *merge* the contents of the
# two files, showing you a unified table of contents for all packages.
# This is really nice.
