          Hello! This is a news entry and it represents an
          experimental new feature of Home Manager. The idea is to
          inform you when something of importance happens in Home
          Manager or its modules.

          We will try to not disturb you about the same news more than
          once so the next time you run

              home-manager switch

          or

              home-manager build

          it should not notify you about this text again.

          News items may be conditional and will then only show if the
          condition holds, for example if they are relevant to your
          configuration.

          If you want to see all relevant news then please use the

              home-manager news

          command.

          Since this is an experimental feature any positive or

          It is now possible to use Home Manager as a NixOS module.
          This allows you to prepare user environments from the system
          configuration file, which often is more convenient than
          using the 'home-manager' tool. It also opens up additional
          possibilities, for example, to automatically configure user
          environments in NixOS declarative containers or on systems
          deployed through NixOps.

          This feature should be considered experimental for now and
          some critial limitations apply. For example, it is currently
          not possible to use 'nixos-rebuild build-vm' when using the
          Home Manager NixOS module. That said, it should be
          reasonably robust and stable for simpler use cases.

          To make Home Manager available in your NixOS system
          configuration you can add

              imports = [
                "''${builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz}/nixos"
              ];

          to your 'configuration.nix' file. This will introduce a new
          NixOS option called 'home-manager.users' whose type is an
          attribute set mapping user names to Home Manager
          configurations.

          For example, a NixOS configuration may include the lines

              users.users.eve.isNormalUser = true;
              home-manager.users.eve = {
                home.packages = [ pkgs.atool pkgs.httpie ];
                programs.bash.enable = true;
              };

          and after a 'nixos-rebuild switch' the user eve's
          environment should include a basic Bash configuration and
          the packages atool and httpie.

          More detailed documentation on the intricacies of this new
          feature is slowly forthcoming.

          Briefly, the state version indicates a stable set of option

          option default in a way that may cause program breakage it
          will do so only for the unstable state version, currently

          compatible changes will be made and 19.09 becomes the
          unstable state version.

          The default value for this option is 18.09 but it may still
          be a good idea to explicitly add

              home.stateVersion = "18.09";

          If you don't override values within systemd units then you are not
          affected by this change. Unfortunately, if you do override unit values
          you may encounter errors due to this change.

          In particular, if you get an error saying that a "unique option" is
          "defined multiple times" then you need to use 'lib.mkForce'. For

          Unfortunately this will most likely trigger an "Existing

          the listed '.xpi' files and try again.

          This change also means that extensions installed through
          Home Manager may disappear from unmanaged profiles in future
          Firefox releases.

          The 'services.compton' module has been deprecated and

          is because Nixpkgs no longer packages compton, and instead
          packages the (mostly) compatible fork called picom.

          The 'services.compton' and 'services.picom' modules have a
          few differences:

            - 'services.picom' has a new 'experimentalBackends'
              option.

            - 'vSync' is now a boolean value on 'services.picom', as
              opposed to the string in 'services.compton'.

          Migrating to the new picom service is simple - just change
          all references to 'services.compton' to 'services.picom',
          and adhere to the above changes.

          The deprecated 'services.compton' will eventually be removed
