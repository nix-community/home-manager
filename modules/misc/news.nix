          Hello! This is a news entry and it represents an
          experimental new feature of Home Manager. The idea is to
          inform you when something of importance happens in Home
          Manager or its modules.

          We will try to not disturb you about the same news more than
          once so the next time you run

              home-manager switch

          or

              home-manager build

          it should not notify you about this text again.

          News items may be conditional and will then only show if the
          condition holds, for example if they are relevant to your
          configuration.

          If you want to see all relevant news then please use the

              home-manager news

          command.

          Since this is an experimental feature any positive or
          negative feedback would be greatly appreciated. For example,
          by commenting in https://git.io/v5BJL.

                for variable expansion.

                To continue setting session variables from the Home
                Manager configuration you must either use the
                'programs.bash' or 'programs.zsh' modules or manually
                source the session variable file

                more information. This file requires a Bourne-like shell
                such as Bash or Z shell but hopefully other shells
                will be supported in the future.

                If you specifically need to set a session variable using
                PAM then the new option 'pam.sessionVariables' can be
                used. It works much the same as 'home.sessionVariables'
                but its attribute values must be valid within the PAM
