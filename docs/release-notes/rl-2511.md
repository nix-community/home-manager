# Release 25.11 {#sec-release-25.11}

This is the current unstable branch and the information in this
section is therefore not final.

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.11-highlights}

This release has the following notable changes:

- Updating the `home-manager` Nix profile inside the activation script
  now deprecated. The profile update is instead the responsibility of
  the software calling the activation script, such as the
  `home-manager` tool.

  The legacy behavior remains the default for backwards compatibility
  but may emit a deprecation warning in the future and in the longer
  term removed all together. If you have developed tooling that
  directly call the generated activation script, then you are
  encouraged to adapt to the new behavior. See the
  [Activation](#sec-internals-activation) section in the manual for
  details on how to call the activation script.

- The `home-manager switch` command now offers a `--rollback` option.
  When given, the switch performs a rollback to the Home Manager
  generation prior to the current before activating. While it was
  previously possible to accomplish this by manually activating an old
  generation, it always created a new profile generation. The new
  behavior mirrors the behavior of `nixos-rebuild switch --rollback`.
  See the [Rollbacks](#sec-usage-rollbacks) section for more.

- The `home-manager switch` command now offers a
  `--specialisationÂ NAME` option. When given, the switch activates the
  named specialisation. While it was previously possible to accomplish
  this by manually running the specialisation `activate` script it was
  quite cumbersome and always created a new profile generation. The
  new behavior mirrors the behavior of `nixos-rebuild switch
  --specialisation`.

- When using Home Manager as a NixOS or nix-darwin module we
  previously created an unnecessary `home-manager` per-user "shadow
  profile" for the user. This no longer happens. You can restore the
  old behavior by adding

  ``` nix
  home-manager.enableLegacyProfileManagement = true;
  ```

  to your configuration. This option is likely to be deprecated in the
  future.
