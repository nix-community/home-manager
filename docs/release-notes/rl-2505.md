# Release 25.05 {#sec-release-25.05}

This is the current unstable branch and the information in this
section is therefore not final.

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.05-highlights}

This release has the following notable changes:

- The [](#opt-systemd.user.startServices) option now defaults to
  `true`, meaning that services will automatically be restarted as
  needed when activating a configuration.

  Further, the `"legacy"` alternative has been removed and will now
  result in an evaluation error if used.

  The `"suggest"` alternative will remain for a while longer but may
  also be deprecated for removal in the future.

- The Home Manager test suite has been removed from the main Nix Flake
  since it caused unnecessary evaluations and downloads. Instead the
  tests are available through a Nix Flake file inside the `tests`
  directory. See [](#sec-tests) for example commands.
