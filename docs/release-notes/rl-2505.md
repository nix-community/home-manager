# Release 25.05 {#sec-release-25.05}

The 25.05 release branch became stable in May, 2025.

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.05-highlights}

This release has the following notable changes:

- The [](#opt-systemd.user.startServices) option now defaults to
  `true`, meaning that services will automatically be restarted as
  needed when activating a configuration.

  Further, the `"legacy"` alternative has been removed and will now
  result in an evaluation error if used.

  The `"suggest"` alternative will remain for a while longer but may
  also be deprecated for removal in the future.

- The Home Manager test suite has been removed from the main Nix Flake
  since it caused unnecessary evaluations and downloads. Instead the
  tests are available through a Nix Flake file inside the `tests`
  directory. See [](#sec-tests) for example commands.

- The Home Manager NixOS module now supports
  [home-manager.users](#nixos-opt-home-manager.users) entries that do not have
  corresponding `users.users.<name>` entries, making it easier to provide Home
  Manager configurations for users managed through external identity management
  systems.  To take advantage of this, such users must have their
  [](#opt-home.username) and [](#opt-home.homeDirectory) attributes set to
  high-precedence values with `lib.mkForce` or similar, overriding the defaults
  that pull from, respectively, `users.users.<name>.name` and
  `users.users.<name>.home`.
