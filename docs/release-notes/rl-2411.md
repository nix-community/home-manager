# Release 24.11 {#sec-release-24.11}

The 24.11 release branch became stable in November, 2024.

## Highlights {#sec-release-24.11-highlights}

This release has the following notable changes:

- The swayidle module behavior has changed. Specifically, swayidle was
  previously always called with a `-w` flag. This flag is now moved to
  the default
  [services.swayidle.extraArgs](#opt-services.swayidle.extraArgs)
  value to make it optional.

  Your configuration may break if you already set this option and also
  rely on the flag being automatically added. To resolve this, please
  add `-w` to your assignment of
  [services.swayidle.extraArgs](#opt-services.swayidle.extraArgs).

- Support for Boolean values in the option
  [programs.eza.icons](#opt-programs.eza.icons) is deprecated for
  future removal. The new value for `true` is `"auto"`, and for
  `false` it is `null`.
