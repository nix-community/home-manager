== Release 22.11

The 22.11 release branch became the stable branch in November, 2022.

[[sec-release-22.11-highlights]]
=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* The <<opt-home.stateVersion>> option no longer has a default value.
It used to default to ``18.09'', which was the Home Manager version
that introduced the option. If your configuration does not explicitly
set this option then you need to add
+
[source,nix]
home.stateVersion = "18.09";
+
to your configuration.

* The Flake function `homeManagerConfiguration` has been simplified.
Specifically, the arguments
+
--
  - `configuration`,
  - `username`,
  - `homeDirectory`,
  - `stateVersion`,
  - `extraModules`, and
  - `system`
--
+
have been removed. Instead use the new `modules` argument, which
accepts a list of NixOS modules.
+
Further, the `pkgs` argument is now mandatory and should be set to
`nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system}` where `nixpkgs` is the Nixpkgs
input of your choice.
+
For example, if your Flake currently contains
+
[source,nix]
----
homeManagerConfiguration {
  configuration = import ./home.nix;
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  username = "jdoe";
  homeDirectory = "/home/jdoe";
  stateVersion = "22.05";
  extraModules = [ ./some-extra-module.nix ];
}
----
+
then you can change it to
+
[source,nix]
----
homeManagerConfiguration {
  pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  modules = [
    ./home.nix
    ./some-extra-module.nix
    {
      home = {
        username = "jdoe";
        homeDirectory = "/home/jdoe";
        stateVersion = "22.05";
      };
    }
  ];
}
----
+
Of course, you can move the assignment of <<opt-home.username>>,
<<opt-home.homeDirectory>>, and <<opt-home.stateVersion>> to some
other file or simply place them in your `home.nix`.

* The `services.picom` module has been refactored to use structural
settings.
+
As a result `services.picom.extraOptions` has been removed in favor of
<<opt-services.picom.settings>>. Also, `services.picom.blur*` were
removed since upstream changed the blur settings to be more flexible.
You can migrate the blur settings to use
<<opt-services.picom.settings>> instead.

* The `services.compton` module has been removed. It was deprecated in
release 20.03. Use `services.picom` instead.

[[sec-release-22.11-state-version-changes]]
=== State Version Changes

The state version in this release includes the changes below.
These changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to "22.11" or later.

* The <<opt-services.mpd.musicDirectory>> option now defaults to the
value of <<opt-xdg.userDirs.music>> if <<opt-xdg.userDirs.enable>> is
enabled. Otherwise it is undefined and must be specified in the user
configuration.

* The activation script now resets `PATH` before running. Before, the
user's `PATH` environment variable would be used in the script and
this made it possible for commands in the activation script to run
arbitrary commands accessible to the user. We now restrict the
activation script to commands that are explicitly specified.
+
There is no official way to restore the old behavior. We attempt to
make the activation script as reproducible as possible and honoring
the user's `PATH` reduces reproducibility.
+
If you need to run a command in an activation script block then refer
to the command by its absolute command path, such as
`${pkgs.hello}/bin/hello`.
