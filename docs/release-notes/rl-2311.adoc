This is the current unstable branch and the information in this section is therefore not final.

=== Highlights
:babelfish: https://github.com/bouk/babelfish
:nixpkgs-markdown: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-contributing-markup

This release has the following notable changes:

* When using <<opt-programs.fish.enable>>, the setup code
for <<opt-home.sessionVariables>> is now translated
with {babelfish}[babelfish].
This should result in significantly faster shell startup times
but could theoretically break
if you have very complex bash expressions in a session variable.
Please report any issues you experience.

* The `.release` file in the Home Manager source tree
has been supplanted by `release.json`,
which contains more information about the branch.
If you have any external code reading this file,
please switch to consuming `release.json` instead.
The `.release` file will be removed in 24.05.

* Home Manager has migrated to using
the upstream Nixpkgs `lib.nixosOptionsDoc` processor
for option documentation.
If you have any external Home Manager modules,
their option descriptions and literal examples should be translated
to {nixpkgs-markdown}[Nixpkgs-flavoured Markdown].
