# Release 26.05 {#sec-release-26.05}

This is the current unstable branch and the information in this
section is therefore not final.

## Highlights {#sec-release-26.05-highlights}

This release has the following notable changes:

- The [](#opt-programs.anki.uiScale) option now expects a value in the
  range 1.0–2.0, previously it erroneously expected values in the
  range `0.0–1.0`.

## State Version Changes {#sec-release-26.05-state-version-changes}

The state version in this release includes the changes below. These
changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to
\"26.05\" or later.

- The [](#opt-gtk.gtk4.theme) option does not mirror
  [](#opt-gtk.theme) by default anymore.

- The [](#opt-programs.zsh.dotDir) option now defaults to the XDG
  configuration directory (usually `~/.config/zsh`) when
  [](#opt-xdg.enable) is true.
