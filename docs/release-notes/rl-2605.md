This release has the following notable changes:

## State Version Changes {#sec-release-26.05-state-version-changes}

The state version in this release includes the changes below. These
changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to
\"26.05\" or later.

- The `gtk.gtk4.theme` option does not mirror `gtk.theme` by default
  anymore.

- The `home.uid` option is now required. When using Home Manager as a
  NixOS or nix-darwin module, this is automatically set from
  `users.users.<name>.uid` if that option is defined. For standalone
  usage or when the system user has no explicit UID, set `home.uid`
  to your user's UID (run `id -u` to find it).
