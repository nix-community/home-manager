# Why is there a collision error when switching generation? {#_why_is_there_a_collision_error_when_switching_generation}

Home Manager currently installs packages into the user environment,
precisely as if the packages were installed through `nix-env --install`.
This means that you will get a collision error if your Home Manager
configuration attempts to install a package that you already have
installed manually, that is, packages that shows up when you run
`nix-env --query`.

For example, imagine you have the `hello` package installed in your
environment

``` shell
$ nix-env --query
hello-2.10
```

and your Home Manager configuration contains

``` nix
home.packages = [ pkgs.hello ];
```

Then attempting to switch to this configuration will result in an error
similar to

``` shell
$ home-manager switch
these derivations will be built:

The solution is typically to uninstall the package from the environment
using `nix-env --uninstall` and reattempt the Home Manager generation
switch.

You could also opt to uninstall *all* of the packages from your profile
with `nix-env --uninstall '*'`.
